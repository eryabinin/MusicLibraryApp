# MusicLibraryApp

This app is a tool for a musical librarian to add new materials into catalog database. 
GUI allows you to enter and delete records from and to database.

Problems: It was supposed to be multi layered JPanels interacting with 2 tables in database. 
I wanted to check out materials to users and check back in. My 5 JPanels GUI didn't work and I didn't know how to make it work.


Cool feature:
It is supposed to play background music. There is special code and BGM button on the Panel. 
In theory it works, well it worked for youtube video I watched about it, but I get IOException error with either .mp3 or .wma
